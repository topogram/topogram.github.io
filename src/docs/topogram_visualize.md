step: 9

You may know be able to visualize the topogram graphs.


### Time series

On the top, a timeseries represent the volume of messages containing the keyword or expression over time. 

### Semantic Graph

Behind it here the **semantic graph**. You can explore it and save it by clicking on the "save" button. You will also see a list of the most important words in the graph. Colors represent scales of degree in the graph (number of connections of a word). You can browse the list of words by degree in using the table on the left. In graph theory, the [degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(graph_theory)) represent the number of connections of a specific node to the rest of the network.

NB : If you want to exclude words, you should use the "stopwords" function while creating the topogram.

### Retweets and comments count

You can see the most retweeted or most commented tweets by sorting the table behind the graphs using the "retweet" column.

NB : Don't forget to add those columns when you describe the data.
