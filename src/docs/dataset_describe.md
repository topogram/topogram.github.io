```/#/datasets/<id>```

When you click on a specific dataset, you will be ask to "describe the dataset" by chosing which columns represent text, time, author as well as the language of the text and the formating of the time. The default time formating is based on the APEC Dataset so you may not have to change this.

Once you have selected the right columns, you can update the description and start indexing the dataset.
